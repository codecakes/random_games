Master Method Case 3 Recursive computation:

When a \> b\^d Tn = O(log\^a, b)

Integer Multiplication: 	

Convetional: 4 FPOps: O(n\^2) 	

Gaussian: 3 FPOps: \~O(n\^1.59)

Matrix Multiplication: 	

Conventional: 8 FPOps: O(n\^3) 	

Strassens' Method: 7 FPOps: \~ O(n\^2.81)

Generally, recursive algorithms can be solved using traditional logic vs
improved logic in following manner given in Big-O(n\^x):

FPOps - x=Traditional - x=Improved

4	log4		log(4-1)

8	log8		log(8-1) N	logN		log(N-1)
